# DISCOVER Serenity  (logo)

## Project Description (elevator pitch)

The Covid-19 pandemic has reshaped every aspect of our lives, the initial global lock-down has slowed down the virus spread and a new normal way of experience the world with safety has been established.

Discover Serenity is a web application that provides users with the best hiking trail options in the United States, avoiding crowds and therefore easier to find serenity outdoors. The app provides updated and reliable information on hiking trails with fewer people and fewer health risks.


## Application Concept (Motivation)

"Find a hiking trail with fewer people and fewer COVID-19 risks while still finding the most beautiful places that nature has to offer!"

Outdoor activities are an important aspect of life, people want to be able to take a break from being home and refresh their body and mind without feeling exposed to the novel Coronavirus. Considering this new reality, we created DISCOVER Serenity as powerful an accessible solution to plan a great trip to nature in all safety.
